My Final Project for Purdue University's ENGR133 course: a 2x2 Rubik's Cube solving program in Python
***
## How to Use:
- Run this python program
- type `help` to learn the order to input your cube's stickers to the program
- re-run the program, and enter your cube's stickers in order
- a solution to your 2x2 is printed.

## Sample Output:

```runfile('C:/Users/yello/Desktop/final_project_tkodonne_rubiks_solver.py', wdir='C:/Users/yello/Desktop')

Input cube state (type "help" for help): WRRRGWWOGGGOYYWYBOBBBORY

   solution to your cube:

  L D L' R U' R' U' R U R' F' R U R' U' R' F R L D' L
  R' R U' R' U' R U R' F' R U R' U' R' F R R
  D' F' R U' R' U' R U R' F' R U R' U' R' F R F D
  D2 R R U' R' U' R U R' F' R U R' U' R' F R R' D2
